# entropylab-docs

This repository builds the documentation of the [entropylab](https://github.com/entropy-lab/entropy) project
and deploys a [static site](docs.entropy-lab.io) from them. 

The static site is built with [mkdocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

Automatic API documentation is done using the [mkdocstrings](https://github.com/mkdocstrings/mkdocstrings) addon.

Entropy is an open project and contributions, including to its documentation, are welcome.
